### Source Code Standards

Formatting can be done simply by using clang-format, with the vscode extension. Make sure it is both installed on the system and in vscode.

C source and header files can use this template, and doxygen comments:

### Notes
- Install platformio on vscode
- open the "open_car_diagnostics_esp32" folder as a project with platformio
- run build, upload, and monitor
- connect to the wifi AP using the credentials set in wifi.c
- connect as udp client to the esp32 with: `nc -u 192.168.4.1 8888` (change out the ip and port if they change)
- you should be able to type text and hit enter, and see it received on the esp32 monitor.
